# Meek

Meek is currently under development.

Meek is a statically typed, imperative, procedural programming language.

It looks a lot like C right now, but I have plenty of ideas to try out once development is further along.

Currently working on...

- ~Scanner and parser~
- Analysis (type checking, name resolution, etc.)
- LLVM output + integration
