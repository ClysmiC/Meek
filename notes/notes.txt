type coercion

int = 32 bit int
float = 32 bit float

if those ranges don't suffice for you, you should have enough domain knowledge to know to use s64 / f64 instead. The existence of those more specific types are self-documenting.


you can only coerce if you don't lose information
u8 -> u16 -> u32 -> u64
s8 -> s16 -> s32 -> s64


all comparisons < > <= >= on numeric values will do necessary type casts before comparing. MAYBE not between int/float values if the cast can get it wrong...

you can coerce from any ptr to byte ptr. (maybe need to be the same degree, however? i.e., can't coerce ^^int to ^byte)

nothing implicitly coerces to/from boolean (MAYBE a null pointer does to false)...
